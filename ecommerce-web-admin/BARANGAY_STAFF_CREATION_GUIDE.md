# Barangay Staff Account Creation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Admins can now create barangay staff accounts in **TWO WAYS**:

### ✨ Option 1: Create New Account (RECOMMENDED)
Admin directly creates a brand new barangay staff account without requiring the user to register first.

### 🔄 Option 2: Assign Existing User
Convert an existing user (buyer/seller) to a barangay staff member.
