# 🏘️ Important: Barangay Account Naming Convention

## ⚠️ Critical Understanding

### What to Enter in the "Name" Field

## 🎯 Why Organization Names?

### Reason 1: Multiple Staff Members
- One barangay account can be used by **multiple staff members**
- Different people may login at different times
- Shared responsibility for deliveries and pickups

### Reason 2: Continuity
- Staff members may change
- The barangay/cooperative remains
- Account stays valid even with personnel changes

### Reason 3: Clear Identification
- Orders show which barangay is handling them
- Customers see organizational names
- More professional and official

## 🔐 Account Sharing

### How It Works:
1. Admin creates ONE account with organization name
2. Multiple authorized staff members can use the same credentials
3. They all login with the same email/password
4. They manage deliveries for their barangay

### Best Practices:
✅ **DO:**
- Share credentials only with authorized staff
- Keep a master list of who has access
- Change password if staff leaves
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Keep credentials confidential

❌ **DON'T:**
- Share credentials publicly
- Give access to unauthorized people
- Use the same password for other accounts
- Write passwords in public places

## 📞 Questions?

**Q: Can I change the name later?**
A: Yes, you can update it in the Firestore database if needed.

**Q: What if the barangay name is very long?**
A: You can use abbreviations (e.g., "Brgy. San Jose" instead of "Barangay San Jose").
