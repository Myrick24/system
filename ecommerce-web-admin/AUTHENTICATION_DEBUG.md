## Authentication Flow Debug Guide

### What I Fixed:

1. **Added Detailed Logging**: 
   - AuthContext now logs all authentication state changes
   - ProtectedRoute logs why redirects happen
   - AdminService logs admin checking process

2. **Fixed Login Flow**:
   - Login function no longer sets loading to false immediately
   - onAuthStateChanged properly handles state transitions
   - LoginPage automatically redirects when auth succeeds

3. **Improved Admin Checking**:
   - AdminService now queries Firestore for admin users
   - Better error handling and logging

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Open Browser Console** to see detailed logs
2. **Try logging in** with your admin credentials
3. **Check the logs** to see where the process fails:

**Expected log flow:**
```
Attempting to sign in... {email: "admin@example.com"}
Sign in successful: [UserCredential object]
Auth state changed: {user: true, uid: "...", email: "admin@example.com"}
User logged in, checking admin status...
Checking admin status for userId: [UID]
Found admin user: {docId: "...", userData: {...}}
User is confirmed admin
Admin status result: true
Auth state update complete
ProtectedRoute check: {user: true, isAdmin: true, loading: false}
User is authenticated and admin, showing dashboard
```

### If Still Not Working:

1. **Go to `/debug` page** and:
   - Test Network Connection
   - Test Firebase Authentication  
   - Check User in Database
   - List All Admins

2. **Make sure you have an admin user** in Firestore:
   - Collection: `users`
   - Document with field: `role: "admin"`

3. **Check browser console** for any errors

The app should now properly redirect to the dashboard after successful admin login!
