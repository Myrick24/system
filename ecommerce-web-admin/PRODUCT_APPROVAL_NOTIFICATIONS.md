```

## üìä Database Structure

### Notifications Collection
Each notification in Firestore has this structure:

```javascript
{
  userId: "user_id_here",           // Seller or buyer ID
  title: "Product Approved!",       // Notification title
  message: "Great news! Your...",   // Detailed message
  type: "product_approval",         // Type of notification
  read: false,                      // Read status
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),     // When created
  data: {                           // Additional metadata
    productId: "product_id",
    productName: "Product Name",
    category: "Category",           // For buyer notifications
    reason: "Rejection reason"      // For rejections
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### NotificationService Integration:
```typescript
export class ProductService {
  private notificationService: NotificationService;

  constructor() {
    this.notificationService = new NotificationService();
  }
  
  async approveProduct(productId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // 1. Get product details
    const productData = await getDoc(productRef);
    
    // 2. Update status
    await updateDoc(productRef, { status: 'approved' });
    
    // 3. Notify seller
    await this.notificationService.sendNotificationToUser(
      sellerId, 
      'üéâ Product Approved!', 
      message,
      'product_approval'
    );
    
    // 4. Notify all buyers
    await this.notifyBuyersAboutNewProduct(productId, productName, category);
  }
}
```

### Buyer Notification Logic:
```typescript
private async notifyBuyersAboutNewProduct(
  productId: string, 
  productName: string, 
  category: string
): Promise<void> {
  // Get all users with buyer role
  const buyersQuery = query(
    collection(db, 'users'),
    where('role', '==', 'buyer')
  );
  
  const buyers = await getDocs(buyersQuery);
  
  // Send notification to each buyer in parallel
  const promises = buyers.docs.map(buyer => 
    this.notificationService.sendNotificationToUser(
      buyer.id,
      'üÜï New Product Available!',
      `Check out our new product: "${productName}" in ${category} category.`,
      'product_approval'
    )
  );
  
  await Promise.all(promises);
}
```

- All timestamps use `serverTimestamp()` for consistency
- Notification service is reusable across different admin actions
- Mobile app already has notification display system in place
- System supports both seller and buyer notification types

---

## üéØ Result

**Sellers** now receive instant notifications when their products are approved or rejected (with reasons), and **buyers** are automatically notified when new products become available - creating a complete, automated notification flow that keeps everyone informed!

---

## üìû Support

If notifications aren't appearing:
1. Check Firestore `notifications` collection for new entries
2. Verify user IDs match between `users` and `notifications` collections
3. Check mobile app notification permissions
4. Review console logs for any errors
5. Ensure NotificationService is properly initialized
