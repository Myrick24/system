## 🚀 How It Works

### Complete Flow (10 Steps):

```
1. User selects "GCash" payment → Clicks "Place Order"
2. Order created in Firestore (status: "pending")
3. App calls PayMongo API to create GCash source
4. PayMongo returns checkout URL
5. App opens URL in WebView (seamless in-app experience)
6. User logs in to GCash and confirms payment
7. PayMongo processes payment and redirects
8. App detects redirect and verifies payment status
9. Payment record saved to Firestore
10. Success dialog → Redirect to Orders screen
```

### Time Required:
- **Development**: ✅ Complete (today)
- **Setup**: 15 minutes (PayMongo account + API keys)
- **Testing**: 5 minutes per payment test
- **Production**: Ready (just switch to live keys)
