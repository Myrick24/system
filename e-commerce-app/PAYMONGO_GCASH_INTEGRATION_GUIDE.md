## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create PayMongo Account

1. Go to https://dashboard.paymongo.com/signup
2. Fill in your business details:
   - Business Name
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number
   - Business Type

3. Verify your email address

4. Complete business verification:
   - Upload business documents
   - Provide bank details for payouts
   - Wait for approval (usually 1-3 business days)

### Step 2: Get API Keys

1. Log in to PayMongo Dashboard: https://dashboard.paymongo.com
2. Navigate to **Developers** ‚Üí **API Keys**
3. You'll see two sets of keys:

   **TEST KEYS** (for development):
   ```
   Public Key: pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   Secret Key: sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

   **LIVE KEYS** (for production):
   ```
   Public Key: pk_live_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   Secret Key: sk_live_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

4. Copy both TEST and LIVE keys (keep them secure!)

### Step 3: Configure API Keys in Your App

Open `lib/services/paymongo_service.dart` and update the API keys:

```dart
class PayMongoService {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è REPLACE THESE WITH YOUR ACTUAL KEYS
  
  // FOR TESTING (starts with pk_test_ and sk_test_)
  static const String _publicKey = 'pk_test_YOUR_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';
  static const String _secretKey = 'sk_test_YOUR_TEST_SECRET_KEY_HERE';
  
  // FOR PRODUCTION: Switch to live keys (pk_live_ and sk_live_)
  // static const String _publicKey = 'pk_live_YOUR_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';
  // static const String _secretKey = 'sk_live_YOUR_LIVE_SECRET_KEY_HERE';
  
  // ... rest of code
}
```

### Step 4: Update Redirect URLs

In `lib/services/paymongo_service.dart`, update the redirect URLs (around line 56):

```dart
'redirect': {
  'success': 'https://your-app.com/payment/success',  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Update this
  'failed': 'https://your-app.com/payment/failed',    // ‚ö†Ô∏è Update this
},
```

**Options for redirect URLs:**

1. **Use your website URL** (recommended):
   ```dart
   'success': 'https://yourdomain.com/payment/success',
   'failed': 'https://yourdomain.com/payment/failed',
   ```

2. **Use placeholder URLs** (for testing):
   ```dart
   'success': 'https://example.com/payment/success',
   'failed': 'https://example.com/payment/failed',
   ```
   
   The app will still detect payment completion even with placeholder URLs.

### Step 5: Test the Integration

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\Mikec\system\e-commerce-app
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test payment flow**:
   - Browse products
   - Click "Buy Now"
   - Select "GCash" as payment method
   - Click "Place Order"
   - Complete payment in GCash page

### Step 6: Use Test GCash Account

PayMongo provides test credentials for GCash:

**Test GCash Number**: `09123456789`  
**OTP Code**: `123456`

This allows you to test the full payment flow without real money.

   ‚Üì
   App calls PayMongo API to create GCash source
   POST https://api.paymongo.com/v1/sources
   ‚Üì

4. RECEIVE CHECKOUT URL
   ‚Üì
   PayMongo returns checkout URL
   Example: https://payments.paymongo.com/sources/src_xxxxx
   ‚Üì

   ‚Üì

9. APP DETECTS REDIRECT
   ‚Üì
   WebView navigation delegate detects URL change
   ‚Üì

10. CHECK PAYMENT STATUS
    ‚Üì
    App calls PayMongo API to verify payment
    GET https://api.paymongo.com/v1/sources/{source_id}
    ‚Üì

11. UPDATE FIRESTORE
    ‚Üì
    Payment status updated in Firestore
    Order status updated to "confirmed" (if paid)
    ‚Üì

12. SHOW CONFIRMATION
    ‚Üì
    Success dialog displayed to user
    User redirected to Orders screen
```

### Payment Statuses:

| Status | Description | User Action |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `pending` | Payment source created, awaiting user action | Complete payment in GCash |
| `chargeable` | Payment successful, ready to be charged | None - automatic |
| `cancelled` | Payment was cancelled by user | Retry payment |
| `failed` | Payment failed | Try different method |
| `expired` | Payment source expired (30 min timeout) | Create new payment |

## Testing Guide

### Test Mode vs Live Mode

**Test Mode** (Development):
- Use test API keys (`pk_test_...` and `sk_test_...`)
- No real money is charged
- Use test GCash credentials
- Perfect for development and QA

**Live Mode** (Production):
- Use live API keys (`pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`)
- Real money is charged
- Requires real GCash account
- Only use after thorough testing

### Step-by-Step Testing:

1. **Ensure Test Keys Are Active**:
   ```dart
   static const String _publicKey = 'pk_test_YOUR_KEY';
   static const String _secretKey = 'sk_test_YOUR_KEY';
   ```

2. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Complete Test Purchase**:
   - Navigate to a product
   - Click "Buy Now"
   - Select quantity
   - Choose delivery method
   - **Select "GCash" as payment method**
   - Click "Place Order"

4. **In the GCash Payment Screen**:
   - Wait for PayMongo page to load
   - Click "Pay with GCash"
   - Use test credentials:
     * Mobile Number: `09123456789`
     * OTP: `123456`
   - Confirm payment

5. **Verify Success**:
   - Success dialog should appear
   - Check Firestore for payment record
   - Check order status is updated

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Payment source creation works
- [ ] WebView loads PayMongo page
- [ ] GCash login page appears
- [ ] Test credentials work
- [ ] Payment confirmation succeeds
- [ ] Success dialog appears
- [ ] Payment recorded in Firestore
- [ ] Order status updated
- [ ] User redirected to Orders screen
- [ ] Payment failure handling works
- [ ] Cancel button works
- [ ] Network error handling works

## Configuration

### PayMongo Dashboard Settings

1. **Webhook Configuration** (Optional but recommended):
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Add webhook URL: `https://your-backend.com/webhooks/paymongo`
   - Select events:
     * `source.chargeable` - Payment successful
     * `payment.paid` - Payment completed
     * `payment.failed` - Payment failed
   
2. **Business Settings**:
   - Add business logo
   - Configure email notifications
   - Set up payout schedule

3. **Test Mode Toggle**:
   - Dashboard has "Test Mode" toggle
   - Always test in Test Mode first
   - Switch to Live Mode only when ready

### App Configuration:

**Environment-based Keys** (Best Practice):

Create separate config files for test and production:

```dart
// lib/config/payment_config.dart
class PaymentConfig {
  static const bool isProduction = false; // Set to true for production
  
  static String get publicKey => isProduction 
    ? 'pk_live_YOUR_LIVE_KEY'
    : 'pk_test_YOUR_TEST_KEY';
    
  static String get secretKey => isProduction
    ? 'sk_live_YOUR_LIVE_KEY'
    : 'sk_test_YOUR_TEST_KEY';
}
```

Then use in PayMongoService:

```dart
static String get _publicKey => PaymentConfig.publicKey;
static String get _secretKey => PaymentConfig.secretKey;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "No currently active project" when deploying rules

**Solution**:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project e-commerce-app-5cda8
```

### Issue 2: WebView not loading

**Causes**:
- Invalid API keys
- Network connection issue
- PayMongo service down

**Solution**:
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check internet connection
- Check PayMongo status page

### Issue 3: Payment not completing

**Causes**:
- Redirect URLs not configured
- Navigation delegate not detecting URL

**Solution**:
- Check redirect URLs in code
- Verify URL detection logic in `_handleUrlChange()`
- Add debug prints to track URL changes

### Issue 4: "Payment source creation failed"

**Causes**:
- Invalid API keys
- Incorrect API endpoint
- Network timeout

**Solution**:
- Double-check secret key format
- Verify API endpoint URL
- Increase timeout duration

### Issue 5: Firestore permission denied

**Cause**: Security rules not deployed

**Solution**:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project e-commerce-app-5cda8
```

### Issue 6: Test GCash credentials not working

**Cause**: Using live mode keys instead of test mode

**Solution**: Ensure you're using `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` keys

## Security Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: API Key Security

1. **NEVER commit API keys to Git**:
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   lib/config/payment_config.dart
   ```

2. **Use environment variables**:
   ```dart
   static const String _secretKey = String.fromEnvironment('PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY');
   ```

3. **Backend API recommended** (Production):
   - Don't store secret keys in mobile app
   - Create backend API to handle PayMongo calls
   - Mobile app calls your API, API calls PayMongo

### Recommended Architecture (Production):

```
Mobile App
   ‚Üì
Your Backend API (Node.js, PHP, etc.)
   ‚Üì
PayMongo API
```

This keeps your secret key secure on the server.

### Firestore Security:

Current rules ensure:
- Users can only access their own payments
- Users cannot modify payment amounts
- Admins can view all payments
- Proper authentication required

---

## Database Structure

### `paymongo_payments` Collection:

```javascript
{
  // Document ID: PayMongo source ID (e.g., "src_abcd1234")
  
  "sourceId": "src_abcd1234",           // PayMongo source ID
  "orderId": "order_1234567890",        // Your order ID
  "userId": "user_abc123",              // Buyer's user ID
  "amount": 299.00,                     // Payment amount
  "checkoutUrl": "https://...",         // PayMongo checkout URL
  "status": "chargeable",               // Payment status
  "paymentMethod": "gcash",             // Payment method used
  "orderDetails": {                     // Order information
    "productName": "Product Name",
    "quantity": 2,
    "unit": "kg",
    "deliveryMethod": "Pickup at Coop"
  },
  "createdAt": Timestamp,               // Creation timestamp
  "updatedAt": Timestamp                // Last update timestamp
}
```
