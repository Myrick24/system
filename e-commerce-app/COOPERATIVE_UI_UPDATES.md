## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
`lib/screens/account_screen.dart`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Added Cooperative Flag
```dart
bool _isCooperative = false; // Flag to track if user is a cooperative
```

#### 2. Check User Role on Load
```dart
// Check if user is a cooperative
if (userData != null && userData['role'] == 'cooperative') {
  setState(() {
    _isCooperative = true;
  });
  print('User is a cooperative member');
}
```

#### 3. Added Cooperative Dashboard Button
```dart
// Coop Dashboard section for cooperative users
if (_isCooperative)
  Container(
    // Blue gradient card with business icon
    // Tappable to navigate to CoopDashboard
    onTap: () {
      Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => const CoopDashboard(),
        ),
      );
    },
    ...
  ),
```

#### 4. Modified "Become a Seller" Condition
```dart
// Before: if (!_isRegisteredSeller)
// After:  if (!_isRegisteredSeller && !_isCooperative)
```
