## Technical Details

### Delivery Option Values
```dart
final List<String> _deliveryOptions = [
  'Cooperative Delivery',  // Cooperative delivers to buyer
  'Pickup at Coop'         // Buyer picks up at cooperative
];
```

### Payment Option Values

## Order Data Structure

When an order is created, it now contains:

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "Cooperative Delivery" // or "Pickup at Coop",
  "paymentMethod": "Cash on Delivery" // or "GCash",
  // ... other order fields
}
```

---

## What Was Removed

### Removed Features:
- ❌ Meet-up location input field
- ❌ Meet-up location validation
- ❌ Individual "Meet-up" delivery option
- ❌ "Cash on Meet-up" payment option
- ❌ "Cash on Pick-up" payment option (replaced with "Cash on Delivery")

### Why Removed:
These features were for peer-to-peer transactions between individual buyers and sellers. In a cooperative model, the cooperative acts as the intermediary, so direct meet-ups are not needed.

### Order Flow:

```
Buyer places order
    ↓

    ↓

    ↓
Seller delivers to Cooperative
    ↓
Cooperative quality checks
    ↓
If "Cooperative Delivery":
    → Cooperative delivers to buyer's address
    → Buyer pays cash or via GCash
    
If "Pickup at Coop":
    → Buyer notified order ready
    → Buyer goes to cooperative
    → Buyer picks up and pays
