## Notes

1. **Cooperative Account Creation**: The create functionality shows a placeholder message as it requires backend Cloud Functions to properly create Firebase Auth accounts. This should be implemented with proper backend support.

2. **User Feedback Collection**: This feature assumes you have a `user_feedback` collection in Firestore. Users can submit feedback through the app, and admins can manage it here.

3. **Icon Updates**: Updated icons to be more descriptive of each section's purpose.

4. **Simplified Access**: Focused on 5 core admin responsibilities for better usability and reduced complexity.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Backend for Cooperative Creation**: Set up Firebase Cloud Functions to handle cooperative account creation with Firebase Auth.

2. **Create User Feedback Submission Form**: Add a form in the user-facing part of the app to submit feedback that saves to the `user_feedback` collection.

3. **Test All Features**: Go through the testing checklist above.

4. **Consider Adding**:
   - Email notifications when admins respond to user feedback
   - Export functionality for system activities
   - Analytics dashboard with more detailed charts
   - Search functionality in cooperative management

## Summary

✅ **Completed**:
- Revised admin dashboard to 5 focused sections
- Created Cooperative Management screen
- Created User Issues & Feedback screen
- Updated navigation and drawer menu
- Removed unnecessary features (User Management, Products, Settings)
- All files compile without errors

The admin dashboard is now streamlined and focused on the 5 core responsibilities you requested!
