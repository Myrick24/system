RealtimeNotificationBadge(
  child: Icon(Icons.notifications),
)
```

### Listen to New Notifications:

  print('New notification: ${notification['title']}');
  // Do something
});
```

### Get Unread Count:
```dart
final count = await RealtimeNotificationService.getUnreadCount();
print('Unread: $count');
```

### Mark All as Read:
```dart
await RealtimeNotificationService.markAllAsRead();
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the notification"

**Check these:**
1. Is user logged in? Print `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser`
2. Did you use the correct `userId` in the notification?
3. Is internet connected?

**Quick test:**
```dart
// Add this to your initState or button
RealtimeNotificationService.notificationStream.listen((data) {
  print('ðŸ“¨ Notification received: $data');
});
```

### "Badge not showing"

The badge only shows when there are **unread** notifications.

**Test:**
```dart
final count = await RealtimeNotificationService.getUnreadCount();
print('Unread count: $count');
```

### "No sound/vibration"

**Check:**
1. Phone not on silent mode
2. App has notification permissions
3. Volume turned up

**Verify permissions:**
```dart
final settings = await FirebaseMessaging.instance.getNotificationSettings();
print('Permission: ${settings.authorizationStatus}');
```

## Common Use Cases

```dart
await RealtimeNotificationService.sendNotificationToUser(
  userId: sellerId,
  title: 'ðŸ›’ New Order!',

  additionalData: {
    'orderId': orderId,
    'productName': productName,

```
