# 🔧 PayMongo Account Activation Error - FIXED

## ❌ Error You Encountered

```
PayMongo API Response Status: 401
PayMongo API Error: {
  "errors": [{
    "code": "account_not_activated",
    "detail": "Please activate your account first in order to access this resource."
  }]
}
```

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

Changed from **LIVE keys** to **TEST keys** in `paymongo_service.dart`:

### Before (Using Live Keys):
```dart
static const String _publicKey = 'pk_live_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE';
```

### After (Using Test Keys):
```dart
static const String _publicKey = 'pk_test_YOUR_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY';
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_test_YOUR_TEST_SECRET_KEY';
```

## 🧪 Why Use Test Keys?

### Test Keys (`pk_test_` / `sk_test_`):
- ✅ **Work immediately** - No account activation needed
- ✅ **Free testing** - No real money involved
- ✅ **Unlimited testing** - Test as much as you want
- ✅ **Full features** - Same functionality as live
- ✅ **Safe testing** - Can't make real charges

### Live Keys (`pk_live_` / `sk_live_`):
- ❌ **Require activation** - Need to verify account first
- ❌ **Real money** - Actual charges to customers
- ❌ **Compliance needed** - Business verification required
- ❌ **Production only** - For launched apps
