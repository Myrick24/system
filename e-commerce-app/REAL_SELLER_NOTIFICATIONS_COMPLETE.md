- **Beautiful UI**: Modern card-based design with proper visual hierarchy
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges for read/unread status
- **Interactive Actions**: Mark as read/unread, delete notifications
- **Smart Date Formatting**: Shows relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago", "Just now")
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no notifications exist

#### 3. **Dynamic Notification Badge** (`lib/widgets/notification_badge.dart`)

### How It Works

#### 1. **Admin Approves Product**
```dart
// In admin dashboard, when approving a product:
await _productService.approveProduct(productId);

// This automatically:
// 1. Updates product status to 'approved'
// 2. Creates a notification in Firestore
// 3. Sets priority and timestamp
// 4. Links to the specific product
```

#### 2. **Seller Receives Notification**
```dart
// Seller dashboard automatically shows badge
// Notification screen streams from Firestore
// Real-time updates without refresh needed
```

#### 3. **Firestore Data Structure**
```javascript
// notifications collection
{
  userId: "seller_id",
  title: "Product Approved! üéâ",
  message: "Great news! Your product 'Fresh Tomatoes' has been approved...",
  type: "product_approved",
  productId: "product_id",
  read: false,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp,
  priority: "high"
}
```
