## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

**Check 1: Permissions**
```dart
// In app, check notification permissions
Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Enabled
```

**Check 2: FCM Token**
```dart
// Add debug code to check FCM token
final token = await PushNotificationService.getCurrentToken();
print('FCM Token: $token');
```

**Check 3: Firestore Rules**
```bash
# Redeploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Check 4: Console Logs**
```
Look for:
- "Error sending notification: ..."
- "Error creating notification record: ..."
- "Notification sent successfully"
```

### Notifications in Firestore But No Push

**Issue**: Records created but no device notification

**Solution 1**: Check FCM setup
```dart
// Verify initialization in main.dart
await PushNotificationService.initialize();
```

**Solution 2**: Test direct notification
```dart
await PushNotificationService.sendTestNotification(
  title: 'Test',
  body: 'Testing push notifications',
);
```

### Push Notifications Work But No Firestore Records

**Issue**: Notifications appear but no database entries

**Solution**: Check Firestore write permissions
```javascript
// In firestore.rules
allow create: if request.auth != null;
```
