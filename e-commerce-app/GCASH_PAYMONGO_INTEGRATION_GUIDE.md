## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get PayMongo API Keys

1. **Sign up** at [https://paymongo.com](https://paymongo.com)
2. **Verify your account** (required for live payments)
3. **Get API Keys** from [Dashboard > Developers > API Keys](https://dashboard.paymongo.com/developers/api-keys)

You'll get:
- **Public Key** (pk_test_xxx for testing, pk_live_xxx for production)
- **Secret Key** (sk_test_xxx for testing, sk_live_xxx for production)

### Step 2: Update API Keys

Open `lib/services/paymongo_service.dart` and replace:

```dart
// Line 22-23
static const String _publicKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';
static const String _secretKey = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE';
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- Use **TEST keys** (pk_test_ / sk_test_) during development
- Switch to **LIVE keys** (pk_live_ / sk_live_) for production
- **Never commit** API keys to public repositories
- Consider using environment variables for production

### Step 3: Test Payment Flow

1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. Browse products
3. Add items to cart or use "Buy Now"
4. Select **"GCash"** as payment method
5. Choose delivery option
6. Click "Place Order"
7. You'll see the **PayMongo GCash Screen** with:
   - Amount to pay
   - **QR Code** (scan with GCash)
   - "Open GCash App" button
8. Complete payment in GCash
9. Automatically returns to app with success notification

## üß™ Testing

### Test Mode (Using Test API Keys)

PayMongo test mode lets you simulate payments **without real money**:

1. Use **test API keys** (pk_test_ / sk_test_)
2. Test GCash payments will show test checkout URLs
3. Payment status will update after clicking "I've Paid" button
4. **No actual GCash charges occur**

### Test Scenarios

‚úÖ **Successful Payment**
- Click "Open GCash" or scan QR
- In test mode, manually click "I've Paid"
- Should show success dialog
- Should navigate to orders

‚úÖ **Cancelled Payment**
- Click back button during payment
- Confirm cancellation
- Should return to checkout

‚úÖ **Multiple Items**
- Add multiple products to cart
- Select GCash
- Should show total amount
- Should display "X items" in payment screen

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. API Keys
```dart
// ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode in production
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_live_xxx';

// ‚úÖ DO: Use environment variables
static String get _secretKey => 
    const String.fromEnvironment('PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY');
```

### 2. Server-Side Verification
For production, implement webhook verification:
```dart
// In paymongo_service.dart - verifyWebhookSignature() method
// PayMongo sends webhooks to confirm payments
// Verify signature to ensure webhook is genuine
```

### 3. Firestore Rules
Ensure payment records are secure:
```javascript
// In firestore.rules
match /paymongo_payments/{paymentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId 
              || hasRole('admin');
  allow write: if false; // Only backend can write
}
```

---

## üé® Customization

### Change QR Code Size
```dart
// In paymongo_gcash_screen.dart, line ~650
QrImageView(
  data: _checkoutUrl!,
  size: 250.0, // Change this value
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
)
```

### Change Brand Colors
```dart
// In paymongo_gcash_screen.dart
// Update gradient colors
gradient: LinearGradient(
  colors: [Colors.blue.shade700, Colors.blue.shade500],
  // Change to your brand colors
)
```

### Add Payment Fee
```dart
// In buy_now_screen.dart / cart_screen.dart
final paymentFee = totalAmount * 0.02; // 2% fee
final finalAmount = totalAmount + paymentFee;

// Pass finalAmount to PayMongoGCashScreen
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: QR Code Not Showing
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure qr_flutter is installed
cd e-commerce-app
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Issue 2: GCash App Not Opening
**Cause:** Deep linking issue on Android/iOS

**Solution (Android):**
```xml
<!-- In android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml -->
<queries>
  <intent>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <data android:scheme="https" />
  </intent>
</queries>
```

**Solution (iOS):**
```xml
<!-- In ios/Runner/Info.plist -->
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>gcash</string>
  <string>https</string>
</array>
```

### Issue 3: Payment Status Not Updating
**Check:**
1. Internet connection
2. PayMongo API keys are correct
3. Firestore permissions allow writes
4. Check Flutter console for errors

### Issue 4: API Error "Invalid API Key"
**Solution:**
1. Verify API keys are correct in `paymongo_service.dart`
2. Make sure no extra spaces in keys
3. Use test keys for testing, live keys for production
4. Check PayMongo dashboard for key status

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Track Payment Success Rate
```dart
// In paymongo_service.dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logEvent(
  name: 'payment_attempt',
  parameters: {
    'payment_method': 'gcash',
    'amount': amount,
  },
);
```

### Monitor Failed Payments
```dart
// When payment fails
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logEvent(
  name: 'payment_failed',
  parameters: {
    'reason': errorMessage,
    'amount': amount,
  },
);
```
