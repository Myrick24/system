# 🔔 System Notifications - Updated Guide

## ✅ What Changed

The notification system has been updated to show **real system notifications** that appear as:
- 📱 **Floating pop-ups** when the app is open
- 🔔 **System notification tray** notifications 
- 🎵 **Sound and vibration** alerts
- 🛎️ **Badge counts** on the app icon

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### When App is Open (Foreground)
- Notifications appear as **floating pop-ups** over your app
- They also go to the **notification tray**
- **Sound and vibration** included

### When App is Closed/Background
- Notifications appear directly in the **system notification tray**
- Tap to open the app
- **Full system integration**

### When App is Terminated
- System handles notifications automatically
- Appears in notification tray
- Opens app when tapped

## 🧪 Testing the New System

### Method 1: Use Test Buttons
1. **Open your app** and find the orange notification test button
2. **Tap any test button** (Welcome, Order, Product, etc.)
3. **Look for the pop-up** if app is open
4. **Check your notification tray** (swipe down from top)
5. **Tap the notification** to see interaction

### Method 2: Direct Code Testing
```dart
import 'utils/notification_test_helper.dart';

// Each test now sends BOTH:
// 1. FCM notification (stored in database)
// 2. Direct system notification (immediate display)

await NotificationTestHelper.testWelcomeNotification();
await NotificationTestHelper.testOrderNotification();
await NotificationTestHelper.testProductNotification();
```

### Method 3: Direct System Notification
```dart
import 'services/push_notification_service.dart';

// Send notification directly to system tray
await PushNotificationService.sendTestNotification(
  title: 'Test Notification! 🎉',
  body: 'This will appear in your notification tray',
);
```
