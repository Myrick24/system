## üîí Security Rules

All Firestore rules are properly configured:
```javascript
// Users can only read their own notifications
allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;

// Authenticated users can create notifications
allow create: if request.auth != null;

// Users can update their own notifications (mark as read)
allow update: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId &&
  request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['read']);
```

## üîß How Notifications Work

### Checkout Flow (Automatic) ‚úÖ

1. **Buyer adds items to cart**
2. **Buyer completes checkout**
3. **CartService.processCart() executes**
4. **Automatically sends TWO notifications:**
   ```dart
   // 1. To Buyer
   NotificationManager.sendCheckoutConfirmationToBuyer(
     buyerId: buyerId,
     productName: "Fresh Tomatoes",
     quantity: 2,
     unit: "kg",
     totalAmount: 25.50,
     orderId: orderId,
   );
   
   // 2. To Seller
   NotificationManager.sendCheckoutNotificationToSeller(
     sellerId: sellerId,
     productName: "Fresh Tomatoes",
     quantity: 2,
     unit: "kg",
     totalAmount: 25.50,
     buyerName: "John Doe",
     orderId: orderId,
   );
   ```
5. **Both notifications stored in Firestore**
6. **Real-time update in notification screen**

### Product Approval Flow (Automatic) ‚úÖ

1. **Seller submits new product**
2. **Admin approves product**
3. **ProductService triggers notifications:**
   ```dart
   // 1. Notify seller
   NotificationManager.sendProductApprovalNotification(
     sellerId: sellerId,
     productName: "Fresh Tomatoes",
     isApproved: true,
   );
   
   // 2. Notify all buyers
   NotificationManager.sendNewProductToBuyers(
     productId: productId,
     productName: "Fresh Tomatoes",
     sellerName: "Green Farm",
     category: "Vegetables",
     price: 5.99,
   );
   ```

### Seller Registration Flow (Automatic) ‚úÖ

1. **User applies as seller**
2. **Admin reviews application**
3. **Admin approves/rejects**
4. **Notification sent automatically:**
   ```dart
   NotificationManager.sendSellerRegistrationNotification(
     userId: userId,
     userName: userName,
     isApproved: true, // or false
     rejectionReason: "Optional reason if rejected",
   );
   ```
