# ✅ COMPLETE FIRESTORE RULES FIX - ALL COLLECTIONS

## 🔴 Root Cause

The checkout was failing because **THREE critical collections had NO Firestore rules**:

1. ❌ `seller_notifications` - Missing entirely
2. ❌ `reservations` - Missing entirely  
3. ❌ `product_orders` - Missing entirely

When the checkout process tried to write to these collections, Firestore applied the **default deny rule** (`allow read, write: if false`), causing `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.

---

## 🟢 What I Fixed

Added complete Firestore security rules for all missing collections:

### 1. seller_notifications Collection
```firerules
match /seller_notifications/{notificationId} {
  // Sellers can read their own notifications
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.sellerId == request.auth.uid;
    
  // System can create seller notifications (during order creation)
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Sellers can update their notifications (mark as read/handled)
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.sellerId == request.auth.uid;
    
  // Admins can manage all seller notifications
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
}
```

**Why it's needed:**
- During checkout, system creates seller notifications to alert sellers of new orders
- Without this rule, notifications couldn't be created → checkout fails

### 2. reservations Collection
```firerules
match /reservations/{reservationId} {
  // Users can read reservations they created or are selling
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || 
     resource.data.sellerId == request.auth.uid);
     
  // Users can create reservations
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
     
  // Users can update their own reservations
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || 
     resource.data.sellerId == request.auth.uid);
     
  // Allow authenticated users to list reservations
  allow list: if request.auth != null;
     
  // Admins can manage all reservations
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
  
  // Reservation items subcollection
  match /items/{itemId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
      (get(...).data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
       get(...).data.sellerId == request.auth.uid ||
       isAdmin());
  }
}
```

**Why it's needed:**
- Users can reserve products for future pickup
- During checkout, reservations are created alongside orders
- Without this rule, reservations can't be created → checkout fails for reservations

### 3. product_orders Collection
```firerules
match /product_orders/{productId} {
  // Allow authenticated users to read product orders
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Allow creation of product orders during checkout
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Admins can manage all product orders
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
  
  // Orders subcollection
  match /orders/{orderId} {
    // Allow authenticated users to read
    allow read: if request.auth != null;
    
    // Allow creation during checkout
    allow create: if request.auth != null;
    
    // Admins can manage
    allow write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
  }
}
```

**Why it's needed:**
- Tracks all orders for each product
- Helps sellers see all orders for their products
- During checkout, order references are created here
- Without this rule, order tracking fails

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still getting PERMISSION_DENIED?
1. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Sign out completely** (not just app, full sign out)
3. **Wait 3 minutes** for rules to propagate globally
4. **Sign back in**
5. **Try checkout again**

### Can't see collection in Firebase?
- Collections are created automatically when first document is added
- After successful checkout, refresh Firebase Console to see it

### See "Missing or insufficient permissions" in logs?
- Verify you're signed in as authenticated user (not guest)
- Check your user ID matches in Firestore
- Make sure rules were published successfully
