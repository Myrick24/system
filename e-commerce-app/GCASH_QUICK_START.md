---

## Files Changed

2. **`lib/screens/paymongo_gcash_screen.dart`** - Added QR code display
3. **`lib/screens/cart_screen.dart`** - Added GCash payment flow
4. **`lib/screens/buy_now_screen.dart`** - Already had GCash support
5. **`lib/services/paymongo_service.dart`** - PayMongo API integration

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get PayMongo API Keys (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://paymongo.com
2. Sign up for free account
3. Navigate to: **Dashboard > Developers > API Keys**
4. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

### Step 2: Add Your API Key (1 minute)

Open `lib/services/paymongo_service.dart` (Line 22-23):

```dart
// Replace this line:
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_test_KiH6sokR7sk8UnqoMzUHRmHb';

// With your actual secret key:
static const String _secretKey = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE';
```

### Step 3: Run & Test (2 minutes)

```bash
cd e-commerce-app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Test flow:**
1. Browse products
2. Click "Buy Now" or add to cart
3. Select **"GCash"** as payment method
4. Click "Place Order"
5. **See the QR code!** 🎉
6. Scan QR with GCash app OR click "Open GCash App"

---

## 📱 How It Works for Users

### Two Ways to Pay:

**Method 1: Scan QR Code**
```
User sees QR code → Opens GCash app → 
Scans QR → Confirms payment → Done!
```

**Method 2: Auto-Open GCash**
```
User clicks "Open GCash App" → 
GCash opens automatically → 
Confirms payment → Returns to app → Done!
```

---

## 🎯 What Happens When User Pays

1. **Payment Screen Appears**
   - Shows amount to pay
   - Displays scannable QR code
   - "Open GCash App" button

2. **User Pays in GCash**
   - Scans QR or app opens automatically
   - Logs into GCash
   - Confirms payment

3. **App Detects Payment**
   - Checks status every 3 seconds
   - Shows success dialog when paid
   - Navigates to orders automatically

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Use Test Mode (Free Testing)
```dart
// In paymongo_service.dart
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_test_xxx'; // Test key = Free testing
```

### Switch to Live Mode (Real Money)
```dart
// In paymongo_service.dart  
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_live_xxx'; // Live key = Real payments
```

**⚠️ Important:**
- **Test keys** = No real money, unlimited testing
- **Live keys** = Real money, real GCash charges
- Start with test keys, switch to live when ready to launch

---

## 💰 Supported Payment Flows

### ✅ Buy Now (Single Product)
- User clicks "Buy Now" on product
- Selects GCash
- Pays via QR/app
- Order confirmed

### ✅ Cart Checkout (Multiple Items)
- User adds items to cart

- Selects GCash
- Pays total amount
- All orders confirmed

### ✅ Both Work Perfectly!
- QR code shows checkout URL
- User can scan or click to open
- Payment tracked in Firestore
- Success/failure handled

---

## 📊 What Gets Saved in Database

Every payment creates a record in Firestore:

**Collection:** `paymongo_payments`

```javascript
{
  sourceId: "src_abc123",      // PayMongo ID
  orderId: "order_xyz789",     // Your order ID  
  userId: "user_456",          // Buyer's user ID
  amount: 299.99,              // Payment amount
  status: "chargeable",        // pending/chargeable/failed
  paymentMethod: "gcash",      // Payment type
  checkoutUrl: "https://...",  // QR code data
  createdAt: "2025-10-29...",
  updatedAt: "2025-10-29..."
}
```

You can query these to show payment history!

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### Change QR Code Size
```dart
// In paymongo_gcash_screen.dart (line ~650)
QrImageView(
  size: 300.0,  // Bigger QR code
  // or
  size: 200.0,  // Smaller QR code
)
```

### Change Payment Button Color
```dart
// In paymongo_gcash_screen.dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    backgroundColor: Colors.green,  // Your brand color
  ),
)
```

### Add Payment Fee (e.g., 2%)
```dart
// In buy_now_screen.dart or cart_screen.dart
final subtotal = widget.product['price'] * _quantity;
final fee = subtotal * 0.02;  // 2% fee
final total = subtotal + fee;

// Pass 'total' to PayMongoGCashScreen
```

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Showing?
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### GCash App Won't Open?
- Make sure GCash is installed on test device
- Check internet connection
- Try scanning QR code instead

### Payment Status Not Updating?
- Check API keys in `paymongo_service.dart`
- Verify internet connection
- Look at Flutter console for errors

### "Invalid API Key" Error?
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Make sure no spaces before/after key
- Verify key is from correct environment (test vs live)
