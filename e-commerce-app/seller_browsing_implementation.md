   - Account Screen ‚Üí "Browse & Shop" banner (approved sellers only)

2. All navigation routes to `/buyer-browse` which opens the buyer product browsing screen

Sellers now have full access to browse and purchase products while retaining all their existing seller capabilities, creating a complete dual-role experience within the app.
